# Moisture Budget
By Sandro W. Lubis (PNNL)

The column moisture budget equation describes the changes in moisture in a vertical column of the atmosphere. It states that the change in water vapor mixing ratio with respect to pressure, $∂q/∂t$, is equal to the sum of various terms (see the equation below). The first term in the right-hand side of Eq. represents the horizontal advection of moisture, the second term the horizontal moisture convergence, the third term the flux
form of vertical moisture advection, and the fourth term moisture loss (gain) due to the condensational heating (raindrop-induced evaporation in the unsaturated atmosphere and surface evaporation) processes. When the equation is in a steady-state, meaning that the change in moisture with respect to time is zero, the equation can be simplified. Neglecting the storage term, the balance in the moisture budget is between the total moisture flux convergence and the net precipitation, which is approximately equal to the difference between the precipitation and evaporation rates. Positive values of total moisture flux convergence correspond to positive net precipitation and vice versa.
